# GUIonCSharpMono
This repository was preliminary written as tests for C# GUI in Mono with `System.Windows.Forms`
And some other resources such as `SerialPort`

It evolved to sort of a library to include in C# projects for a special power controller (called gCAU) and produce a standalone set of executable applications depending solely on a .Net Framework developed under *Visual Studio* targeting to run under *Windows*

Possibility to run under other contexts, like with Mono under Linux or other .Net releases is however not excluded, hence this repo title

A notable addition is the YAML package copied from work Junfeng Liu. More on this [in this document](YAML.md)
